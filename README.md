## 🌍 Project Overview

**The Great Class Quest** is a sophisticated web application that gamifies the classroom experience. It replaces traditional behavior charts with a living, breathing RPG-style interface.

- **Triple-layer competition:** Class vs. class on the **Team Quest** map, student vs. student in **Hero's Challenge** for rank and "Prodigy of the Month," and **guild vs. guild** in a year-long race toward the **Guild Ceremony**.
- **Automated tracking:** Stars, gold, inventory, tests, attendance, and logs are stored in **Firestore** and stay in sync.
- **AI-powered narrative:** **Gemini** writes daily chronicles, certificates, and story illustrations.
- **Live display:** **Dynamic Wallpaper Mode** turns your screen into a real-time quest dashboard with day/night, weather-aware sky, rotating cards, and celebrations.

---

## 📜 The Quest Master's Philosophy

The app is built on four pedagogical pillars:

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Dual-Layer Motivation** | **Team Quest:** The class advances together on a map (social cohesion). **Hero's Challenge:** Students compete for rank and Prodigy status (personal accountability). |
| **Tangible "Gold" Economy** | Stars become purchasing power. The **Mystic Market** (seasonal + **Legendary Artifacts**) and **Hero's Boon** (peer-to-peer gift) teach delayed gratification and generosity. |
| **Visual Feedback Loops** | Progress is never abstract: progress bars, floating stats, growing avatars, **League Map** zones (Bronze → Silver → Gold → Crystal), and **Wallpaper Mode** keep the quest visible. |
| **AI as the "Dungeon Master"** | AI narrates daily logs, suggests words for Story Weavers, generates avatars and certificates, and powers **Hero's Chronicle** reports. |

---

## 🧭 Navigation at a Glance

| Tab | Purpose |

## 🧭 Core Gameplay Loop

### 1. Setup & Roster (**My Classes**)
- **Class:** Name, logo, schedule (days/times), **Quest League** (difficulty/age).
- **Roster:** Add students; each has Total Stars, Monthly Stars, Gold, Inventory, **Hero Class**, avatar, birthday, nameday.
- **Personalization:** Edit student → Birthday, **Nameday** (with **AI Nameday Lookup** for Greek Orthodox Εορτολόγιο), **Hero Class** (optional lock).

### 2. The Daily Session (**Award**)
- Choose student + reason (Teamwork, Creativity, Respect, Focus, Welcome Back, Scholar Bonus, Story Weaver, etc.).
- **Visual feedback:** Particle effects + unique sound (e.g. Magic Chime).
- Data (timestamp, reason, value) is written to Firestore; **Hero Class** can grant **+10 Gold** for matching reason.

### 3. The End-of-Day Ritual (**Log**)
- **"Log Today's Adventure"** sends the day’s events to the AI.
- AI writes a whimsical diary entry; an AI image generator creates a **storybook-style** illustration.
- Entry is stored and can be revisited; **Pathfinder's Map** and **Mask of the Protagonist** can be reflected in the narrative.

---

## 💰 The Economy System: Gold & Shop

### 🪙 Gold Coins
- **Earning:** 1 Star = 1 Gold. **Bonus Gold:** e.g. "2x Days," **Hero Class** match (+10), **Scroll of the Gilded Star** (3× next star).
- **Spending** Gold does **not** lower Leaderboard rank (Total Stars are separate).

### 🎪 The Mystic Market (Hero's Challenge → Shop)
- **Seasonal stock:** AI generates ~15 items per month by season and league (e.g. Ice Sword in winter; Junior = toys/stickers, Senior = RPG-style artifacts).
- **Legendary Artifacts:** Always available; fixed list of **power-ups** (see below). Different purchase limits (e.g. 2 Legendary per student per month; Pathfinder’s Map 1 per class per month).
- **Purchase:** Up to **2 items per month** per student (seasonal); Legendary limits apply per type. Items appear in the student’s **Inventory** and in the **Enlarged Avatar** pop-up.

### ⚔️ Legendary Artifacts (Power-Ups)

| Artifact | Price | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Crystal of Clarity** | 15 | Pulsing “hint pass” gem on the student’s card. |
| **Scroll of the Gilded Star** | 20 | Next star earned = **3× Gold**. |
| **Time Warp Hourglass** | 25 | **+5 minutes** to all active class bounty timers. |
| **Elixir of Luck** | 30 | 20% chance for **+1 star** on next lesson. |
| **The Herald's Banner** | 40 | School-wide victory celebration toast. |
| **The Starfall Catalyst** | 50 | **Double** the stars from the next high test (Starfall). |
| **The Pathfinder’s Map** | 60 | **+10 Stars** for the Team Quest (class limit: 1/month). |
| **The Mask of the Protagonist** | 75 | Student is the **hero** of the next story log. |

*Use from Inventory in the Hero Stats / enlarged avatar flow; consuming applies the effect and removes the item.*

### 🛡️ Hero Classes
Students can choose a **Hero Class** (e.g. Guardian, Sage, Paladin, Artificer, Scholar, Weaver, Nomad). When you award a star for that class’s **reason**, they get **+10 Gold** in addition to the star. Optional **lock** prevents changing class.

### 🎁 Hero's Boon
From the **Award** tab, a student can **Bestow a Boon** on another (cost: **15 Gold**). The receiver gets **+0.5 Stars** (Total + Monthly); the giver gets peer recognition. Builds generosity and community.

---

## 🏠 Home Dashboard

The **Home** tab is your command center and adapts to **weather** and **time of day**.

- **Header:** AI-generated **inspirational quote** (cached daily); background shifts with **weather** (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, stormy) and **day/night** (sunrise/sunset from your location).
- **Time-based greeting:** Good Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night with matching gradient.
- **View modes:**
  - **No class selected:** School-wide stats (School Stars, Heroes count, Treasury), **Global Tools** (Hero Ranks, New Class, **Team History**, **Holiday**, **Plan**, Setup), and **School Schedule** for today.
  - **Class selected:** That class’s monthly stars, goal (holiday/cancellation-adjusted), progress bar, **last story sentence**, quick actions (**Report**, Award, Log, etc.), **today’s schedule**, and class-specific widgets.
- **Shortcuts:** Open **Team History**, **Day Planner**, **Holiday** (Options), **Report** (class), **Settings** (Options).

---

## 🗺️ Team Quest

- **League Map:** SVG path from **Bronze Meadows** → **Silver Peaks** → **Golden Citadel** → **Crystal Realm**. Each class is a moving avatar; position is based on **monthly stars** vs. **monthly goal**. Overlap resolution keeps labels readable.
- **Monthly goal:** Computed from schedule, **school holidays**, and **cancelled lessons** (fewer teaching days ⇒ lower goal). Display shows “goal adjusted by ±X stars” when relevant.
- **Monthly Award Ceremony:** At the start of a new month, **Team Quest** and **Hero's Challenge** tabs **glow** until the ceremony is run. Full-screen animated ceremony with music/sound reveals last month’s **class** and **student** winners with AI-generated commentary.

---

## 🏆 Hero's Challenge

- **Student Leaderboard:** Ranks by Total Stars (and/or Monthly); avatars, **Hero Class** icon, Gold. Click student → **Hero Stats** modal (or enlarged avatar).
- **Hero Stats Modal:** Avatar, name, Hero Class, **Trials Logged**, **Average Test Score**, **Best Test**, dictation summary (Junior: qualitative; Senior: average %). **Performance chart** (test/dictation over time). Links to **Hero's Chronicle** and **Certificate**.

- **Guild View:** Switch the leaderboard to **Guild** mode to see the four guilds ranked by **Total Stars** (cumulative for the whole school year), along with member counts and top contributors.

---

## 🏰 Guilds & Factions

- **Four Guilds:** Every student can belong to one of four guilds, each with its own emblem and theme:
  - **Dragon Flame** – courage, boldness, fiery energy.
  - **Grizzly Might** – strength, teamwork, steady effort.
  - **Owl Wisdom** – curiosity, thoughtful learning, calm focus.
  - **Phoenix Rising** – resilience, bouncing back, never giving up.
- **Guild Sorting Quiz:** From **My Classes → Students (Manage Students)**, students without a guild can take an age-appropriate, story-style **Sorting Quiz**. Their choices are mapped to traits and used to assign a guild in a fun, narrative way.
- **Year-Long Guild Progress:** Every positive star a student earns also feeds their guild’s **Total Stars**. Guild totals **do not reset monthly**; they accumulate across the school year and are the basis for the end-of-year **Guild Ceremony** (e.g. June 2026) to crown the winning guild.
- **Guild Leaderboard:** In **Hero’s Challenge**, switch to **Guild** view to see a compact leaderboard of all guilds with:
  - Total Stars (cumulative, not reset).
  - Member count and a quick list of top contributors.
  - Colors/emblems matching the guild’s identity for quick recognition on the projector.
