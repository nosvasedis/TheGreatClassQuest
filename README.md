⭐ The Great Class Quest 🚀
Your Classroom's Epic Gamified Adventure
Turn every lesson into a quest, every challenge into a milestone, and every student into a hero. Welcome to a new way to inspire and engage your classroom!

</div>

What is The Great Class Quest?
The Great Class Quest is not just a tool; it's a complete classroom management philosophy wrapped in a fun, game-like adventure. It transforms your daily lessons into an exciting journey where students work together as a class and compete as individual heroes to earn Stars of Excellence, collect Gold Coins, unlock Rare Artifacts, and complete Timed Bounties.

It's designed to be simple for teachers, exciting for students, and a powerful way to foster a positive, collaborative, and focused learning environment.

📜 The Quest Master's Philosophy
This app is built on a few core pedagogical principles designed to make learning more engaging and effective.

🏆 Dual Motivation: The Team & The Hero
Students are motivated on two fronts simultaneously.

The Team Quest (Team Quest Tab): The entire class works together to move their team across a virtual quest map. This fosters collaboration, peer support, and a sense of shared purpose.

The Hero's Challenge (Hero's Challenge Tab): Each student's stars also contribute to their individual score. This encourages personal accountability and celebrates individual effort.

💰 The Economy of Effort
Tangible rewards drive engagement.

Gold Coins: For every star earned, a student also earns Gold.

The Mystic Market: Students learn basic financial literacy and decision-making by saving their Gold to purchase unique, AI-generated digital artifacts in the class shop.

✨ Positive Reinforcement Only
This is a system for celebrating success. Stars are awarded for positive behaviors like Teamwork, Creativity, Respect, and Focus. There is no way to lose stars or be punished. This creates a safe environment where students are encouraged to try their best without fear of failure.

🗺️ Making Progress Visible and Fun
Abstract concepts like "good behavior" become tangible. Students can visually see their class advancing on the Quest Map, watch their name climb the Hero's Leaderboard, and look back on their journey in the illustrated Adventure Log.

🧭 Your Adventure Guide: The Core Gameplay Loop
Getting started is quick and easy. This is the essential flow for using the app every day.

First-Time Setup (My Classes Tab <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>): Create your class, give it a fun name and logo, set its schedule, and add your student roster.

During the Lesson (Award Tab <i class="fas fa-star"></i>): This is your main in-class tool. When a student demonstrates excellence, award them stars.

Instant Reward: The student gets +Stars (for the leaderboard) and +Gold (for the shop).

Dynamic Praise: The AI occasionally generates a unique compliment based on the reason for the award.

Live Action (Bounties & Wallpaper): Spice up the lesson by posting a Quest Bounty for the class to chase in real-time, or put the app into Dynamic Wallpaper Mode during quiet study time.

After the Lesson (Log Tab <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i>): Select your class and click "Log Today's Adventure." The AI analyzes the day's awards and writes a short, illustrated story about their achievements for the Adventure Log.

Review & Shop (Hero's Challenge Tab <i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i>): Show students their ranks and let them spend their hard-earned Gold in The Mystic Market.

🛠️ The Quest Master's Toolkit: Advanced Features
Beyond the daily loop, explore these powerful tools to take your quest to the next level.

🎪 The Economy & Shop
The Mystic Market (Accessible via Hero's Challenge): A digital shop stocked with AI-generated items (e.g., "Sword of Truth", "Potion of Focus").

Restocking: The shop inventory changes based on the season (e.g., snowy items in Winter) and the class "League" level. Junior classes see sticker-like toys; Senior classes see RPG-style artifacts.

Purchase Limits: To encourage saving, students are limited to buying 2 items per month.

Inventory: Students build a collection of items visible in their profile.

⚡ Live Classroom Tools
<i class="fas fa-tv"></i> Dynamic Wallpaper Mode: Turn your projector into a "Living Dashboard."

What it does: Replaces the interface with a beautiful, animated scene featuring moving clouds and a real-time Day/Night cycle synced to the sun's actual position in your location.

The Director: The screen automatically cycles through floating cards showing: Top Students, Quest Progress, Attendance Streaks, Active Bounties, and Inspirational AI Quotes. It's the perfect "screensaver" for class downtime.

<i class="fas fa-crosshairs"></i> Quest Bounties (Award Tab): Create short-term, high-energy challenges.

How it works: Set a target (e.g., "Class needs to earn 20 stars") and a time limit (e.g., "Before the lesson ends").

Visuals: A progress bar appears on the Award tab (and Wallpaper mode).

Reward: When completed, a victory fanfare plays!

🎲 Planning & Engagement
The Calendar (<i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Tab): Your hub for planning ahead.

Quest Events: Schedule unique challenges for future dates:

⭐ 2x Star Day: All stars awarded are doubled automatically.

Special Quests: Pre-defined activities like Vocabulary Vault or Grammar Guardians to gamify specific lessons.

✨ Creative & AI-Powered Assistance
The Story Weavers (Ideas Tab): A collaborative storytelling game! You set a "Word of the Day," and the class builds a story one sentence at a time. The AI illustrates each chapter, and completed stories can be archived, narrated, and printed as PDF storybooks.

❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
<details> <summary><strong>What is the difference between Stars and Gold?</strong></summary>


<strong>Stars</strong> determine a student's rank on the leaderboard and help the class move on the map. They are a measure of <em>achievement</em>.


<strong>Gold</strong> is a currency used to buy items in the Mystic Market. Spending Gold does <strong>not</strong> lower a student's rank or Star count. They are a measure of <em>buying power</em>. </details>

<details> <summary><strong>How does the Dynamic Wallpaper know when to show the Moon?</strong></summary>


The app connects to a solar API to fetch the exact Sunrise and Sunset times for your location (defaulting to Greece). The wallpaper automatically transitions from a sunny blue sky to a starry night sky in real-time as the sun goes down outside your window. </details>

<details> <summary><strong>What happens if I award the wrong number of stars?</strong></summary>


On the <strong>Award</strong> tab, a small red "undo" button (<i class="fas fa-times"></i>) appears on a student's card after they've been awarded stars for the day. Click it to reset their daily score to zero. This also deducts the accidentally awarded Gold. </details>

<details> <summary><strong>Can I add stars students earned before I started using the app?</strong></summary>


Yes! Go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab (<i class="fas fa-cog"></i>) and find the <strong>Student Star Manager</strong>. You can retroactively add stars (and gold) for any student on any past date. </details>
