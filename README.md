## What is The Great Class Quest?

**The Great Class Quest** is not just a tool; it's a complete classroom management philosophy wrapped in a fun, game-like adventure. It transforms your daily lessons into an exciting journey where students work together as a class and compete as individual heroes to earn **Stars of Excellence**, unlock achievements, and win amazing prizes.

It's designed to be simple for teachers, exciting for students, and a powerful way to foster a positive, collaborative, and focused learning environment.

## 📜 The Quest Master's Philosophy

This app is built on a few core pedagogical principles designed to make learning more engaging and effective.

#### 🏆 Dual Motivation: The Team & The Hero
Students are motivated on two fronts simultaneously.
- **The Team Quest (`Team Quest` Tab):** The entire class works together to move their team across a virtual quest map. This fosters collaboration, peer support, and a sense of shared purpose.
- **The Hero's Challenge (`Hero's Challenge` Tab):** Each student's stars also contribute to their individual score. This encourages personal accountability and celebrates individual effort.

#### ✨ Positive Reinforcement Only
This is a system for celebrating success. Stars are awarded for positive behaviors like **Teamwork, Creativity, Respect, and Focus**. There is no way to lose stars or be punished. This creates a safe environment where students are encouraged to try their best without fear of failure.

#### 🗺️ Making Progress Visible and Fun
Abstract concepts like "good behavior" become tangible. Students can visually see their class advancing on the **Quest Map**, watch their name climb the **Hero's Leaderboard**, and look back on their journey in the illustrated **Adventure Log**.

#### ✒️ Celebrating the Journey
Learning is a story we write together. Tools like the **Adventure Log** and **Story Weavers** help chronicle your class's unique journey, turning daily achievements into a lasting, cherished memory.

## 🧭 Your Adventure Guide: The Core Gameplay Loop

Getting started is quick and easy. This is the essential flow for using the app every day.

1.  **First-Time Setup (`My Classes` Tab <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>):** Create your class, give it a fun name and logo, set its schedule, and add your student roster. This takes less than 5 minutes.

2.  **During the Lesson (`Award` Tab <i class="fas fa-star"></i>):** This is your main in-class tool. When a student demonstrates excellence, simply select their name, pick a reason (Teamwork, Creativity, etc.), and award them 1, 2, or 3 stars. The app handles the rest!

3.  **After the Lesson (`Log` Tab <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i>):** At the end of class, select your class and click **"Log Today's Adventure."** The AI will analyze the day's awards and write a short, illustrated story about their achievements for the **Adventure Log**.

4.  **Review & Motivate (`Team Quest` <i class="fas fa-route"></i> & `Hero's Challenge` <i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Tabs):** Show your students their progress! Display the class quest map to foster teamwork and the individual leaderboards to celebrate personal growth.

## 🛠️ The Quest Master's Toolkit: Advanced Features

Beyond the daily loop, explore these powerful tools to take your quest to the next level.

### 🎲 Planning & Engagement Tools

- **The Calendar (<i class="fas fa-calendar-alt"></i> Tab):** Automatically displays your class schedule. This is your hub for planning ahead by adding special **Quest Events**.

- **Quest Events (Added via Calendar):** Spice up your lessons by scheduling unique challenges! When you click on a future date in the calendar, you can add one of two types of events:

    #### Standard Events (Automated Effects)
    These events automatically change how stars are awarded on the day they are active.

    -   **⭐ 2x Star Day**
        > A day where every star you award is worth double.
        -   **How it works:** The app automatically multiplies any star award by two. Award 1 star, they get 2. Award 3 stars, they get 6! This applies to both individual and class scores.
        -   ***Example Use Case:*** Set this for a review day before a test or on a Friday to create a fun, high-stakes end to the week.

    -   **🏆 Reason Bonus Day**
        > A day where one of the four core skills (Teamwork, Creativity, Respect, or Focus) is worth an extra star.
        -   **How it works:** When setting the event, you select a specific reason. On that day, any award for that exact reason gets one bonus star. An award for "Teamwork" on a "Teamwork Bonus Day" is worth one more star than usual.
        -   ***Example Use Case:*** If your class is struggling with focus, set a "Focus Bonus Day" to specifically encourage and reward that behavior.

    #### Special Quests (Teacher-Led Activities)
    These are pre-defined game ideas. The app helps you schedule them and set a reward, but you run the actual activity in your classroom.

    -   **💎 Vocabulary Vault**
        > "Challenge the class to use a set of new vocabulary words a target number of times."
        -   **How to run:** Set a numerical goal (e.g., 20) and a star bonus. In class, make tally marks on the board when students use a target word. If they reach the goal, award the bonus stars.

    -   **🔗 The Unbroken Chain**
        > "Challenge each student to speak about a topic for a short time without hesitation or repetition."
        -   **How to run:** A great fluency warm-up. Announce that every student who successfully speaks for 30 seconds on a topic will earn a +0.5 star bonus.

    -   **🛡️ Grammar Guardians**
        > "Present sentences with grammatical errors and have the class work together to 'rescue' them by finding the corrections."
        -   **How to run:** Set a goal (e.g., correct 10 sentences) and a class-wide bonus. This turns grammar practice into a collaborative team mission.

    -   **✏️ The Scribe's Sketch**
        > "Describe a scene piece by piece and have students draw what they hear to test listening comprehension."
        -   **How to run:** A fun listening exercise to practice prepositions and adjectives. Award a bonus to all who participated well and tried their best.

    -   **📖 Five-Sentence Saga**
        > "Give the class three elements (a character, location, object) and challenge them to write a coherent five-sentence story."
        -   **How to run:** A creative writing challenge for individuals or pairs. Give the elements "a robot," "the moon," and "a banana" and award a bonus for completed stories.

### ✨ Creative & AI-Powered Assistance

-   **The Story Weavers (`Ideas` Tab):** A collaborative storytelling game! You set a "Word of the Day" (or let the AI suggest one), and the class builds a story one sentence at a time. The AI illustrates each chapter, and completed stories can be archived, narrated, and printed as beautiful storybooks.
-   **<i class="fas fa-user-astronaut"></i> The Avatar Forge (`My Classes` Tab):** Personalize your classroom! From the student roster, you can open the Avatar Forge. Choose a creature (like a dragon or robot), a color, and an accessory, and let the AI generate a unique, cute 'chibi' avatar for each student. These avatars appear on leaderboards and the award screen, bringing each hero's identity to life.
-   **Get a Quest Update (`Team Quest` Tab):** The AI generates an exciting, sports-announcer-style narrative about the race between the top classes. You can even play an AI-generated audio narration for extra drama.
-   **The Oracle's Insight (`Ideas` Tab):** Ask the AI specific questions about your class's performance (e.g., "Which student has improved the most in teamwork?"). The Oracle will analyze your data to give you a clear answer.
-   **Reward Idea Generator (`Ideas` Tab):** Stumped for a prize for the winning class? The AI can generate fun, age-appropriate "Special Lesson Experience" ideas.

### 📈 Tracking, Reporting & Celebrating

-   **The Scholar's Scroll (<i class="fas fa-scroll"></i> Tab):** A dedicated academic grade book. Log student scores for **Tests** and **Dictations**. Exceptional performance can trigger a "Starfall Opportunity," letting you award a bonus academic star!
-   **AI-Powered Reports (`My Classes` Tab):** In your class list, click the `Report` button. The AI will analyze the last week of behavioral and academic data for that class and generate an insightful summary, highlighting strengths and suggesting a "mini-quest" for the upcoming week.
-   **Class Overview (`My Classes` Tab):** Click the `Overview` button for a deep-dive dashboard of class and student statistics, including their best month, top skill, and all-time performance highlights.
-   **Attendance Chronicle (`Log` Tab):** Need a detailed attendance record? Click the `Attendance` button for your selected class to view and manage a complete historical grid of presence and absence for every scheduled lesson.
-   **Certificates of Achievement (`My Classes` Tab):** In the student roster, click the certificate icon (<i class="fas fa-award"></i>). The AI will generate a unique, beautifully designed certificate with a personalized message of praise based on that student's recent performance, ready to be downloaded as a PDF.
-   **Historical Leaderboards:** On the `Team Quest` or `Hero's Challenge` tabs, click `View History` to look back at leaderboards from previous months.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
  <summary><strong>How do I correct a mistake if I award the wrong number of stars?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  On the <strong>Award</strong> tab, a small red "undo" button (<i class="fas fa-times"></i>) appears on a student's card after they've been awarded stars for the day. Click it to reset their daily score to zero. For historical mistakes, use the <strong>Student Star Manager</strong> in the <strong>Options</strong> tab.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What if I start using the app mid-year? Can I add stars students earned before I started?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  Yes, absolutely! The app is designed for this. Go to the <strong>Options</strong> tab (<i class="fas fa-cog"></i>) and find the <strong>Student Star Manager</strong>. Here, you can select any student, pick a past date on the calendar, choose the number of stars, and select a reason. This will add a "Historical Award" to their log, update their total score, and ensure all your records are complete.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What's the difference between the Adventure Log and the Scholar's Scroll?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  The <strong>Adventure Log (<i class="fas fa-book-open"></i>)</strong> is a creative, AI-illustrated diary for <strong>behavioral achievements</strong> (Teamwork, Respect, etc.). The <strong>Scholar's Scroll (<i class="fas fa-scroll"></i>)</strong> is a formal grade book for tracking <strong>academic performance</strong> on tests and dictations. They work together to give a complete picture of student progress.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Is the AI safe for the classroom? Does it interact with students?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  The AI is designed as a <strong>teacher's assistant only</strong> and never directly interacts with students. Its purpose is to help you by summarizing data (Reports), generating creative content (Story Weavers, Certificates), and adding a fun flair (Quest Update). All AI-generated content is reviewed and presented by you, the teacher.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How can I share or print the stories we create in Story Weavers?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  Once you finish a story, it gets saved to the <strong>Story Archive</strong> (accessible from the `Ideas` Tab). In the archive viewer, you can generate an AI audio narration of the full story or assemble the entire book—title page, illustrated chapters, and a final "created by" page with all student names—into a single, printable PDF.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How do I add or change a student's avatar?</strong></summary>
  <br>
  Go to the <strong>My Classes</strong> tab (<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i>), click 'Students' for the class, and then click the astronaut icon (<i class="fas fa-user-astronaut"></i>) next to any student's name. This opens the <strong>Avatar Forge</strong>, where you can generate, save, or remove their custom AI avatar.
